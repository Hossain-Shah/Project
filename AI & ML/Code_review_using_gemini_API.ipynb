            "\n",
            "* **`Colab_Notebook/`**: The root directory suggests this is based in Google Colab.\n",
            "* **`Robi_Datathon_0100_pandas/`**:  This directory likely contains all the work related to the Robi Datathon, specifically using pandas. The \"0100\" could be a version or team identifier.\n",
            "* **`shahnawaz/`**: This is a subdirectory likely named after the user or team member.\n",
            "* **`utils/`**:  This subdirectory suggests the notebook inside contains utility functions or general-purpose code. However, in this case, it houses the main solution notebook itself.  This might not be the most ideal organization.\n",
            "* **`Robi_Datathon_problems_solution.ipynb`**: This notebook contains the solutions for the datathon problems, primarily focusing on \"Problem 1\" with a placeholder for \"Problem 2\".\n",
            "* **Data and Output Files (implied):** While not explicitly mentioned in the file paths, `purchase.csv`, `boxes.csv`, `problem1.csv`, and `submission_1.csv` are almost certainly within the `shahnawaz/` directory, potentially directly or in a subfolder like `data/` or `output/`.  A better-organized repository would separate these into distinct folders.\n",

            "**Suggested Improvements:**\n",

            "* **Data directory:** Create a `data/` directory to store the input CSV files (`purchase.csv`, `boxes.csv`, `problem1.csv`).\n",
            "* **Output/Submissions directory:** Create an `output/` or `submissions/` directory to store the generated output files like `submission_1.csv`.\n",
            "* **Refactor Notebook:** Consider splitting the large notebook into smaller, more manageable notebooks or Python scripts for each problem (e.g., `problem_1.ipynb`, `problem_2.ipynb`).\n",
            "* **Move utils:**  If the `utils/` directory is intended for utility functions, create actual utility functions within it and import them into the problem-specific notebooks.  If not needed, remove the directory and place the notebook directly under `shahnawaz/`.\n",
